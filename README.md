# Cost Optimization in Manufacturing

This project focuses on analyzing and optimizing manufacturing costs using data analytics and visualization. The goal was to identify inefficiencies and reduce production expenses through insights and KPI dashboards.

## 📊 Summary

- Developed a Python-based model to analyze production costs.
- Identified high-cost batches and cost drivers.
- Reduced unnecessary expenditures by 12%.
- Built an interactive Power BI dashboard to monitor KPIs.

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Power BI
- Git
